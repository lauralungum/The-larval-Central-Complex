% TODO show figure of CX neuropils without the arrows and also from the side (posterior view and lateral view), to make the point that neurons from lineages that contribute to the adult CX in the larval their arbors project to the spatially corresponding locations. If we were to fuse the left and right hemispheres, the medial larval CX neuropils, in particular the EB and FB, would acquire the compact morphological characteristics of corresponding adult neuropils.



==**TO DO:**==
**Figure 1** (export straight from catmaid)
%TODO: remake cartoon via the catmaid volumes, copy them in ortographic mode then make them 2d.

LAL that follows 

% TODO: Figure 1 needs a cartoon of the larval CNS, with known neuropils labeled like the antennal lobe, optic lobe and mushroom body. Introduces the CNS contour that will be used in figure 2 and others.



% Describe how these neuropil volumes were made: (in the methods at length, here just briefl) by taking the synapses of the the subset of neurons from lineages that in the adult contribute to the CX.



% Add to the legend of this new figure 1 that the PB is in the adult the most posterior-dorsal struture, and this is the case as well in larva. And that the EB is the most anterior medial structure and adjaacent to the MB medial lobe, and this is also the case in larva.
%side view of each neuropil 
- remake them all including PB. 
- there are two pb.b s called SLRs, add them 
%shade axons and dendrites for the NO makes for better figure - it also makes the neuropil more obvious - also do the same for others 



done?? 

**Table 1 Lineages Section**
% The subset of lineages that contribute neurons to the adult central complex
% What percent of these neurons do not correspond to any published paper in the larva
% except for Winding et al. 2023
% What percent of these neurons do not form part of optic lobe, antennal lobe, and mushroom body first order. AL = ~160, OL = ~70, MB = ~300 , total of about 500, whole brain has 2,500

% How many of the neurons from lineages known to contribute to the adult central complex are part of the 500 or of the 2,000.
% That when including Eschbach, Fushiki papers with 2nd order neurons of the MB, and also LH neurons, what percent of those neurons belong lineages that in the adult contribute to the CX.
% Furthermore, the larval LAL was known to exist, what fraction of neurons from lineages that in adult contribute to the LAL or other CX neuropils contriubte to the larval LAL.


**Table 2 & 3** 
double check information and update

**Tables** 
%table with the 8 neurons dalv1, sort them by comparment and color them differently on the columns. on the rows the inputs from the CNs and the MB2ONs, and there should be a diagonal pattern.
% projection neurons from AL (upns and pns), the visual PNs and the projection neurons cold sensors(if they are not called like this email Albert), ascending neurons from proprio.  THEN make the table. 
%table of neurons in adult vs larva - check if pfns and and P-Ns are from similar lineages 

**NO section**
- finish it 

**CX Core neurons**
%TODO: check all the cx core, i.e. .d.b, make sure they are correct girl



**AL OL MB**
%TODO: describe dendritic and axonic contributions in specific (especially from AL, OL and MB)

%TODO: figures with MB and other structures connecting to the CX. especially CNs connecting to every neuropil of the CX.

**More Figures**
Anatomy of the PB neurons. 
Remake the lal volume



TO DO
% swap the fb for fb in the figure. 

% cartoon representation representation of the 3 neurons that do double crossing . 
2+2 compartments . the compartments do share a lot of downstream neurons. 
mediolateral axon -

%for eb there are those neurons that have dendrites completely contained in the EB
%and the eb that has completely composed dendrites and axons in a CX neuron, those are the core neurons so we should highlight them. 
%NO - input output transformation, 7 neurons with axons in noduli. are there neurons that read from all of them; are there neurons that read from subsets of them. what is the structure of the no.d. where do these no.d neurons go. 
Do they talk to other compartments of the central complex; even if they. 
let's look at neurons that make 10 synapses. 


%what fraction is going to the neuropil. how many inputs they recieve. - try see how this goes. NO but not the others. limited amount of interactions there. 
clutchy axons that find the noduli. Where are those axons going and what are the neurons that they are talking.  TRY FOR A DAY not more. - is it worth adding more time. - do this on monday. 



%automation will always find patterns - do they make sense to me? can i relate them to navigation or to multisensory integration; an important pattern is one that you can explain. - one that you can have an explanation for.
